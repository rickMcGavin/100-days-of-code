# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 3, 2016
**Today's Progess**
- 25 minutes on [Lynda.com](http://www.lynda.com)
  - Finished course: Up & Running with Git and Github
- 50 minutes coding FreeCodeCamp Advanced Algorithm Challenge: Inventory Update.
  - Challenge solved.
- 25 minutes reading YDKJS: this & Object Prototypes

**Thoughts:**
I work in Pomodoros, so I consider meeting my coding challenge at 50 minutes per day. I typically always try to read or watch course material as well, but not as much as time spent on code.

The biggest thing I learned today was that I struggled with the Inventory Update challenge largely due to a misunderstanding of how nested for loops would iterate through an array.

I consider it a win that I was able to solve the challenge. Tomorrow I have to start figuring out the next FCC Advanced Algorithm Challenge: No Repeats Please.
