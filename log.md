# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 4: January 5, 2017
**Today's Progress**
- 25 minutes on [Lynda.com](http://www.lynda.com)
  - Continued CSS: Core Concepts course on Front-End Developer Learning Path.
- 50+ minutes on FreeCodeCamp Advanced Algorithm Challenge: Friendly Date Ranges

**Thoughts**
I finally understand how this Date object works. Also, it seems that since FCC used hyphens in the date format, there is some sort of inconsistency. I thought I just didn't understand how the methods worked, but apparently if you replace the hyphens with forward slashes, the dates work right. Glad I figured that out. That little inconsistency completely hung me up on this challenge. I've been able to move forward on it now, and should be able to have it completed tomorrow.

I could have most likely solved it, but in a rare change, I just really enjoyed playing around with the Date object and seeing how it works... in a productive way.

### Day 3: January 4, 2017
**Today's Progress**
- 50 minutes on FreeCodeCamp Advanced Algorithm Challenge: Friendly Date Ranges

**Thoughts**
Life definitely happened today. Got a late start on coding, so I only worked on the FCC challenge instead of my usual routine. I didn't get enough sleep, and I definitely struggled with this date challenge as I barely solved any of the problems in the algorithm. Tomorrow will be better.

### Day 2: January 4, 2017
**Today's Progress**
- 25 minutes on [Lynda.com](http://www.lynda.com)
  - Began course CSS: Core Concepts on Front-End Developer Learning Path.
- 85 minutes on FreeCodeCamp Advanced Algorithm Challenge: No Repeats Please
  - Solved on 4th pomodoro and finished the remaining...
- 15 minutes on reading YDKJS this & Object Prototypes

**Thoughts**
I spent the majority of my time coding as compared to reading or studying the Front-End Developer Learning Path on Lynda. It certainly felt like the most productive use of my time, and I have another FCC challenge solved to show for it. I just need to knock down 4 more of these algorithm challenges before I can start the projects.

### Day 1: January 3, 2017
**Today's Progess**
- 25 minutes on [Lynda.com](http://www.lynda.com)
  - Finished course: Up & Running with Git and Github
- 50 minutes coding FreeCodeCamp Advanced Algorithm Challenge: Inventory Update.
  - Challenge solved.
- 25 minutes reading YDKJS: this & Object Prototypes

**Thoughts:**
I work in Pomodoros, so I consider meeting my coding challenge at 50 minutes per day. I typically always try to read or watch course material as well, but not as much as time spent on code.

The biggest thing I learned today was that I struggled with the Inventory Update challenge largely due to a misunderstanding of how nested for loops would iterate through an array.

I consider it a win that I was able to solve the challenge. Tomorrow I have to start figuring out the next FCC Advanced Algorithm Challenge: No Repeats Please.
